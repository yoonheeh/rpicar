Smartphone controlled Raspberry Pi Car

## Introduction
The final goal of this project is to build an autonomous Raspberry Pi (RPi) vehicle using ultrasonic sensors. However, before reaching the goal, I would like to take a few intermediate steps to learn how to work with Raspberry Pi, how to use keyboard to control pins, how to use a smartphone to control pins and ultimately how to let the RPi car drive itself.  
Before learning how to control DC motor (for RPi car), I started with the easiest example of learning how to control pins: LED lights.

## Step 1: Use a keyboard to control LED lights
There are eight LED lights connected to GPIOs of RPi. Using keyboard input as a control mechanism, the lighted LED can be moved around. (Add a picture)
